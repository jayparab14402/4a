 Working with attributes.
Add vector layer “ne_10m_populated_places_simple.zip” from Practical_No_4 folder.
The selected layer is loaded in QGIS and we can see many points representing the
populated places of the world.
Right-click on the layer and select Open Attribute Table.
Observe the table carefully. We are interested in the pop_max, click twice on the
 field header to sort the column in descending order.
Now we are ready to perform our query on these attributes. Click Select features using
 an expression.
In the “Select By Expression” window, expand the Fields and Values section and double- 
click the pop_max label. This field name is added to the expression section at the bottom.
 If we don’t have idea about the field values, we can click the Load all unique values to 
see what the attribute values. For this exercise, we are looking for all features that have
 a population greater than 1,000,000. So complete the expression as given below.pop_max>1000000
A subset of points is now rendered in yellow. This is the result of query representing all places
 from the dataset that have the pop_max attribute value greater than 1,000,000.
To find the places that are country capitals and pop_max is greater than 1000000. Country capital 
column is adm0cap and 1 represents country capital.pop_max>1000000 AND adm0cap=1
Similarly, to find Indian location where pop_max greater than 100 and less than 1000000.
pop_max>100 AND pop_max<1000000 AND sov0name='India'
Return to main QGIS window, to do some further analysis on this subset of data right- click on the 
ne_10m_populated_places_simple layer and select Properties.
Click on General tab, scroll down to the Feature subset section and click on Query Builder button.
Enter the same expression which we had entered earlier and click OK.pop_max>1000000 AND adm0cap=1
Return in the main QGIS window, we can see all the points disappear except those which satisfy the
 condition. This is because they are still selected. Click on the Deselect Features from All Layers 
button under the Attributes toolbar and click on it.
